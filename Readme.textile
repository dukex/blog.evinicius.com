This is the code responsible for "blog.evinicius.com":http://blog.evinicius.com/.  It's centered around a simple but deceivingly powerful Sinatra app.  It gives you full control of your website and it's a great way to learn Sinatra.  If you're interested in Sinatra, I encourage you to dig in.

This code was inspired by Emilio Cavazos: "iamneato.com":http://iamneato.com
