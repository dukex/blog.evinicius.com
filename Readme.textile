This is the code responsible for "iamneato.com":http://www.iamneato.com/.  It's
centered around a simple but deceivingly powerful Sinatra app.  It gives you
full control of your website and it's a great way to learn Sinatra.  If you're
interested in Sinatra, I encourage you to dig in.

This code was inspired by Hugh Evans:
