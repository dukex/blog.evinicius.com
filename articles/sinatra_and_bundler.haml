  I've been working with "Rails 3":http://guides.rails.info/ a lot lately and
  that work has led to a healthy appreciation for
  "bundler":http://gembundler.com/.  So much so, I figured it would be a good
  idea to update this site (a "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ app) to
  work with "bundler":http://gembundler.com/.  The changes were pretty
  trivial in contrast to all the control you get from using
  "bundler":http://gembundler.com/.

  Here's a quick rundown of what you need to do to get
  "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ and
  "bundler":http://gembundler.com/ working together.

  First thing you need is a Gemfile.

%pre
  %code.ruby<
    :preserve
      # Gemfile

      source 'http://rubygems.org'

      gem 'haml', '3.0.12'
      gem 'RedCloth', '4.2.3'
      gem 'sinatra', '1.0', :require => false

      group :test do
        gem 'rack-test', '0.5.4'
        gem 'rspec', '1.3.0'
      end

:textile
  Notice that the "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ gem is set to
  __:require => false__.  This is Important to keep your existing app
  functioning properly.

  Next I added a *bundler_helper.rb* file to my lib directory to do all the
  auto require magic.

%pre
  %code.ruby<
    :preserve
      # Bundler Helper

      require 'rubygems'
      require 'bundler'

      Bundler.setup unless File.exists?(File.expand_path('../.bundle/environment', __FILE__))
      Bundler.require(:default)

:textile
  Now you can remove all the require calls for external gems inside your app
  file. Well, everything but the line that requires
  "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/.  The first five lines of my
  "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ app now looks like this:

%pre
  %code.ruby<
    :preserve
      # add lib dir to load path
      $:.unshift File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), 'lib')

      require 'bundler_helper'
      require 'sinatra'

:textile
  After that, it's pretty much "bundler":http://gembundler.com/ business as usual.
